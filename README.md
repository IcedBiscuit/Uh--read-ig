 I don't like people who ask me about irl stuff, especially if I don't know you, I will hide or block if you do this

 ◇  I am not a sys, please keep this in mind, I do not have any problems !

 ◇ I'm not 100% how to explain this, but, Ice and Biscuit are 2 different personalities, again, not a System or anything related to that. 

  Feel free to c+h and int, I'm not good at keeping a conversation and I don't understand everything you mean. If you make me uncomfy I will most likely say, please so do you, I can't read minds.

 I spend more time watching videos than actual playing ◇ Don't ask me 2 play with you, I mean you can ask, but I'll likely say no.

  Yes this is *censored* long, but I think I said the most important infos, that people actually want, so here is the other part !

 ÷ Ice absolutely hates giving personal info, is more quiet than Biscuit ◇ He likes the admins and also John and Jane Doe, he actually cried when he heard their lore ◇

 × Biscuit will likely make spellingmistakes (idk how to spell most the time anyway ._.), he is afraid of people with cool skins, he also gets attached more easier than Ice ◇ he likes what Ice likes, but he's more attached to Elliot and Chance than the admins, he doesn't have a fav killer ◇
